# Naimuri Github API task

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this task. I really enjoyed working on it and look foward to discussing!

## About


## To run locally
- `npm i`
- `npm start`
- Should open in browser at `localhost:3000`

## Structure

`create-react-app` for the client with an `express` backend just for the purpose of caching Github's responses (I was exceeding the anonymous API calls during while developing and didn't want to start putting API tokens in env files etc!). With more time I would have more cleanly separated the client and server directories.

## Testing
